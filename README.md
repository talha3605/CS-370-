# CS-370

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was working as an AI developer for a gaming company. The company is developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. As an AI developer, you have been asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate agentâ€™s goal is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent you create will need to find a path towards its goal.

We were given Starter code Which included treasureMaze.py and GameExperiance.py. TreasureMaze was the setup for the matrix that we would be navigating. GameExperiance was the controller that handled all of the game states between the initial startup state and terminal state.

We were given the nerual network but, I was responsible for writing the Deep Q learning implementation that allowed the NPC to learn how to play the game.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
In short a Computer Scientists help to solve fundamental problems in computing. Creating and inventing new technology and computing/languages from the ground up. This will revolutionize how we as a society can handle day to day work. This will allow us to do our jobs better, automate simple processes, and optimize what ever it may be that we are doing. This all has a great effect on us.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
How I typically approach a problem as a computer scientist is to take a look at the big picture of what we want to accomplish, followed by structuring it together. I like to start with a solid foundation and then build off of it, and take the steps in pieces. When approaching our responsibilities for ethical concerns we must do so in a way that doesnt tend to have biases within the code or training. We must consider the impacts of society small and large because the application of our works directly effects us all.
